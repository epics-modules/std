<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>std Release Notes</H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-6 (Aug 6, 2008)</H2>

<ul>

<li>The sseq record was failing to process immediately after a reboot, when
ordered to process because of a CP input link.

<li>The gpibRecord has been replaced by the asynRecord, which is loaded from the
asyn module.

<li>New databases: alarmClock, autoShutter, countDownTimer, ramp_tweak, scaler16m

<li>The sseqRecord (string Sequence, a variant of the seq record in EPICS base)
can now be told to abort the sequence it's executing.

<li>The scaler record has a new field, COUTP, which is like the COUT field, but
is not delayed by a nonzero setting of the DLY field.

<li>If the scaler-record DLY field was less that 1, it was not honored. 
(Thanks to Xuesong Jiao for the fix.)

<li>New link-help displays do a better job of describing the effects on link
attributes, particularly as they bear on completion detection (i.e., the
behavior of a data when written to by ca_put_callback).

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-5 (April, 2007)</H2>
<UL>
  <li> Added scaler16m.db database, and corresponding MEDM displays.  These
       differ from scaler16.db and its display files only in the implementation
	   of end calculations.  The new support provides end calcs for all 16 signals.
  <li> New link-help displays.
  <li> Added pvHistoryRegister to stdSupport.dbd
  <li> Added field COUTP, an output link, to the caler record.  This is similar
       to the COUT link, which sends the value of the CNT field to its target
	   whenever CNT changes.  COUTP differs from COUT in that it doesn't wait for
	   the delay specified in the DLY field, but sends promptly after CNT changes. 
  <LI> Minor change to devScalerAsyn to support change in API for asyn callbacks.
  <LI> Minor change to devEpidFast to support change in API for asyn callbacks.
  <LI> Added ramp_tweak database and assoc. support

  <LI> Minor change to devScalerAsyn to support change in API for asyn callbacks.
  <LI> Minor change to devEpidFast to support change in API for asyn callbacks.
  <LI> Added ramp_tweak database and assoc. support
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-4 (Dec. 6, 2006)</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Changes to scaler record:
        <UL>
          <LI>PRn and Sn fields are now DBF_ULONG rather than DBF_LONG.
	  <LI>No longer hardcode VME_IO device type in the record logic.
	  <LI>Removed .CARD record field.
          <LI>Changed interface to device support so that all functions pass precord 
              rather than card, and init_record passes pointer to device callback structure.
          <LI>Move callback structures from dpvt to rpvt so record does not access dpvt.
	</P>
        </UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added asyn device support for scaler record. This is
            currently used by the SIS3820 device support in mcaApp/SISSrc, but all scaler
            device support will eventually be changed to use asyn.
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Changed stdApp/Db/scaler*.db so that $(OUT) is a
            macro parameter, rather than assuming VME_IO link type.
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deleted CARD field from stdApp/op/adl/scaler*.adl.
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deleted stdApp/src/femto.dbd, not needed.
	<li><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added timer.db (resettable software timer) and
		related software: timer.req, timer*.adl
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-3</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">epid record still had some FLOAT
	stuff to convert to DOUBLE. Fixed record and docs. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">added userStringSeq10 database,
	autosave request, and medm display files.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added support for the Femto
	current amplifier (<A HREF="http://www.femto.de/">www.femto.de</A>).</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-2</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sseqRecord.html rewritten. The old
	version was a minimal modification of seqRecord.html, from the EPICS
	Record Reference Manual, and was not very clear. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scaler record: v3.18: Don't post
	CNT field unless record-support changed its value. Modified debug
	macro. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">devEpidFast.c: changed strtok_r to
	epicsStrtok_r 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pvHistory: new software to
	maintain short-term history of a few PV's in the ioc. Software
	comprises pvHistory.c (genSub routines), devTimeOfDay.c,
	pvHistory.db, pvHistory.req (autosave-request file), and
	pvHistory*.adl, and relies on autosave to save/restore the value
	arrays. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">softMotor.db: shortened some .DESC
	field values so they fit. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">all_com_4.db: new file 
	</P>
	<LI><P>softMotorConfig.adl: related-display callups were using
	sCalcout files for calcout records, because synApps did not contain
	calcout medm displays. Now the calc module does contain calcout
	displays, so we use them. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-4</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">mpf-related stuff replaced by
	asyn-related stuff 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">minor scaler-record changes to
	accommodate Joerger VS series. Existing support for other scaler
	devices should not require any modifications. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BitBus is no longer supported 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ioc-status info now provided by
	vxStats module 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">PID support rearranged around the
	asyn module 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SSEQ-record delays now snap to
	nearest clock period, and show user the delay that will actually be
	used. Fixed bug that was crashing on Linux and Windows. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="cvsLog.txt">cvs log</A> 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-3</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This is what's left of the synApps std module after the
modules autosave, calc, optics, sscan, and vme were split out. 
</P>
<P>This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.
Differences from std 2.2: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">scaler record - device support
	that used &quot;struct callback&quot; defined in devScaler.h must
	now replace that with &quot;CALLBACK&quot;, and must include
	epics/base/include/callback.h 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sseq record - Now allows user to
	specify whether or not the record should wait, after putting a link
	value, for the resulting processing to complete before processing
	the next link. Some code cleanup. Added seqRecDebug. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">topDAC8.adl - Deleted to avoid
	conflict with dac128V module. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">VXstats_full.adl 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">pid_control_settings.req - added
	delta time 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added device-independent scaler
	database and save-restore settings files. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>timeString.db - new capability in 3.14.5: stringin record can
	get time date. 
	</P>
