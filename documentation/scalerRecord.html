<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>

<P>This documentation describes version 3.16 of the EPICS scaler record, and
related EPICS software required to build and use it.  This version of the
record is compatible with EPICS 3.14.5, and is incompatible with any 3.13.x
version of EPICS.

<P>The scaler record provides support for a bank of up to 64 32-bit counters
(scaler channels) controlled by a common start/stop mechanism.  If the
hardware is capable of preset-counter operation, the record divides scaler
channels into two groups according to the values of each channel's
gate-control field (Gn): simple counters [Gn = "N" (0)], and preset counters
[Gn = "Y" (1)].  Simple counters are zeroed immediately before counting
begins, and count upwards.  Preset counters are simple counters that will not
count higher than a preset value.  The first preset counter to reach its
preset value stop all counters.  (The hardware may actually implement a
preset counter by loading in the preset value, and counting down to zero.  If
so, device support is expected to maintain the fiction that all counters
count up from zero.)  Currently device support exists for the Joerger VSC
8 and 16 channel VME scalers; Joerger VS64 fly-counting scalers; and the
SIS3801 multichannel scaler, emulating a single scaler bank.  Joerger VS
scalers do not support preset counting, so the software sets the Gn fields
to 0 and keeps them there.

<P>Scaler channel 1 receives special treatment: it is presumed to count a
reference-frequency clock signal and its value indicates the time interval
during which counting was enabled.  The fields

<UL>
<LI>T (time)
<LI>TP (time preset)
<LI>S1 (scaler channel 1 value)
<LI>PR1 (scaler channel 1 preset value), and
<LI>FREQ (clock frequency)
</UL> satisfy the following equations:
<PRE>
	T = S1 / FREQ
	TP = PR1 / FREQ
</PRE>

The manner in which the time base is managed is different for different
kinds of scaler hardware.

<DL>

<DT>Joerger VSC scalers <DD>It is the user's job to make sure that a
clock signal is presented to the channel-1 input, and that FREQ actually
contains the frequency of the clock signal.  The 10 MHz signal available on
the front panel normally is used for this purpose.

<DT>SIS3801 scalers <DD>Normally, the hardware is set up to connect an
internally generated 25-MHz clock to channel 1, via an internal switch.
(Thus, any external signal connected to SIS3801 channel 1 will be ignored.)
It is possible to use an externally generated clock, and in any case it is
still the user's responsibility to ensure that FREQ contains the correct
value.  The SIS3801 has no actual preset-counter hardware, but software
emulates preset counters by reading the scaler periodically and stopping
it when a channel specified as a preset counter has reached or exceeded the
preset count.

<DT>Joerger VS scalers <DD>This hardware does not implement preset
counters; an internal 16-bit gate-time counter is used to set the counting
time.  The device-support software will choose a reference frequency for this
counter, and cause the hardware to generate and use it.  Also, device-support
will set and post the FREQ field according to the reference frequency it has
chosen.  But the reference signal still must be connected by the user to the
channel-1 input, so that the record and any clients can treat channel 1 as
the time base.

</DL>

<P>This is how the scaler record is intended to be used:
<OL>
<LI>The user sets FREQ to the frequency of the clock signal input to
    scaler channel 1. (Joerger VSC and SIS3801 only)
<LI>The user sets TP (time preset) and/or PRn (preset value for scaler
    channel n).  (For Joerger VS scalers, only TP or PR1 may be set.)
<LI>The user sets CNT to "Count" (1), initiating counting.
<LI>For Joerger VSC and SIS3801 scalers, the counters count until any
    preset counter reaches its preset value, whereupon the record resets
    CNT to "Done" (0), or the user manually resets CNT to "Done" (0),
    causing counting to stop.  For Joerger VS scalers, counters count
    until the internal gate-time counter reaches its preset, or the user
    manually resets CNT to "Done" (0).
</OL>

<P>This version of the scaler record maintains two counting modes: normal and
background (also called AutoCount).  Normal counting is controlled by the CNT
("Count/Done") field, the time preset, and possibly other presets, as
described above.  Background counting is controlled by the CONT
("OneShot/AutoCount") field, normally ignores user preset values, and is
intended to give the user continuous updates whenever the scaler would
otherwise be idle.

<P>When CONT = "AutoCount" (1), and no normal counting operation is
already in progress, the scaler waits for the AutoCount delay (DLY1);
counts for the AutoCount period (TP1); and displays the result.  If the
AutoCount period (TP1) is less than .001 s, we default to the normal
criteria for determining the count period.  If the AutoCount Display
Rate (RAT1) is greater than zero (Hz), then the scaler values are
displayed at that rate while background counting is in progress.

<P>Background counting is interrupted immediately whenever a normal
counting operation is started with the CNT field, and the results of a
normal counting operation are held for ten seconds after the scaler
finishes normal counting, before background counting begins again.
The ten-second data-hold period can be changed by setting the integer
variable 'scaler_wait_time' to the desired hold time in seconds, either
at the ioc console, or in the ioc-startup file, st.cmd.

<P>Background counting never affects the state of the CNT field, so this
field can always be used to determine when a normal counting operation
has begun and finished.

<P>The scaler record is unlike most other EPICS records in that its
processing is neither "synchronous" nor "asynchronous", as these terms
are used in the EPICS Application Developer' Guide.  Currently, the PACT
field is always FALSE after record processing has completed, even
though the scaler may be counting.  This means the record always
responds to channel-access puts, and that counting can be stopped at
any time.  The record's forward link is not executed until the scaler
has stopped counting.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>CNT	<TD>R/W*	<TD>Count	<TD>RECCHOICE <TD>(0:"Done", 1:"Count")
	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
User sets this field to "Count" (1) to start counting.  When a preset is reached,
counting will stop, this field will be reset to "Done" (0), and the forward
link will be fired.  If this field is set to "Done" (0) while counting is in
progress, counting will be stopped, the accumulated counts will be reported,
and the forward link will be fired.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>CONT	<TD>R/W*	<TD>OneShot/AutoCount	<TD>RECCHOICE <TD>(0:"OneShot", 1:"AutoCount")
	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
User sets this field to "AutoCount" (1) to enable background counting.
(See also autocount delay (DLY1), autocount display rate (RAT1), and autocount time presetTP1.)

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>G1...G64	<TD>R/W	<TD>Gate control	<TD>RECCHOICE <TD>(0:"N", 1:"Y")

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
There are 64 of these fields, one per channel.  These fields determine
whether the associated scalers are to be used as simple scalers (Gn=0)
or preset scalers (Gn=1), assuming the hardware is capable.  When Gn is
set to 1, the record will ensure than PRn is nonzero (will set it to 1000,
if it was zero).  When PRn is set to any positive value, the record will
set Gn to 1.  If the hardware does not implement preset scalers, device
support will set these fields to 0 whenever it notices that they have been
set to 1.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>PR1...PR64	<TD>R/W	<TD>Preset n	<TD>LONG

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
Preset values for the associated scalers.  If scaler n has been
designated as a preset scaler (i.e., if Gn=1), then when the scaler
reaches the count PRn, all scalers will be disabled, and the record
will report counting has completed by setting CNT=0.  If scaler n has
not been designated as a preset scaler, the PRn is ignored.  When PRn
changes to any positive value, the record will set Gn to 1.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>TP	<TD>R/W	<TD>Time preset	<TD>DOUBLE

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
This field specifies for how long, in seconds, the scaler is to count
if no other preset stops it.  TP is effectively a proxy for the preset
field, PR1, associated with scaler 1.  Whenever TP changes, the record
will set PR1 = TP*FREQ, and otherwise behave as though the user had
changed PR1.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>TP1	<TD>R/W	<TD>AutoCount Time preset	<TD>DOUBLE

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
This field specifies the background-counting period in seconds.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>DLY	<TD>R/W	<TD>Delay (sec)		<TD>FLOAT

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
The delay, in seconds, that the record is to wait after
CNT goes to 1 before actually causing counting to begin.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>DLY1	<TD>R/W	<TD>AutoCount Delay (sec)		<TD>FLOAT

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
The delay, in seconds, between successive background-counting periods.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>RATE	<TD>R/W	<TD>Display rate (Hz)		<TD>FLOAT

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
This field specifies the rate in Hz at which the scaler record posts
scaler information while counting is in progress.  If this field is
zero, counts are displayed only after counting has stopped.  Max.
rate:  60 Hz

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>RAT1	<TD>R/W	<TD>AutoCount Display rate (Hz)		<TD>FLOAT

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
This field specifies the rate in Hz at which the scaler record posts
scaler information while background counting is in progress.  If this field is
zero, counts are displayed only after background counting has stopped.  Max.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>FREQ	<TD>R/W	<TD>Time base freq. (EGU)		<TD>DOUBLE

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
The frequency (in Hz) of the clock signal counted by scaler 1.  The
record uses this field to convert between time values (T and TP, in
seconds) and values associated with scaler 1 (S1 and PR1).  It is
the user's responsibility to ensure that this field has the correct
value.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>S1...S64	<TD>R	<TD>Scaler n value (EGU)		<TD>LONG

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
The counts accumulated by the scalers.  These are posted periodically (at RATE Hz)
while counting is in progress, and once after counting stops.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>T	<TD>R	<TD>Timer (EGU)		<TD>DOUBLE

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
This field is a proxy for the value field, S1, associated with scaler
1.  Whenever S1 changes, the record will set T = S1/FREQ.
