<h1>The synApps std module</h1>
The std module publishes the following software items for use by ioc applications
:

<h2>Records<hr></h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="epidRecord.html">epidRecord.html</a><dd>Extended PID feedback record
<dt><a href="scalerRecord.html">scalerRecord.html</a><dd>Scaler record
</dl>

<h2>Databases and GUI display files<hr></h2>


<h3>4step.db, 4step.adl</h3>

<P>Implements a multistep measurement that may involve up to four sets of the
following operations:
 <ol>
 <li>set conditions and wait for completion (execute a string-sequence record)
 <li>trigger up to two detectors and wait for completion 
 <li>acquire scalar data from up to four PVs, for each measurement step,
 and cache in local PVs.
 </ol>
 
<P>When all measurement steps have completed, performs up to four calculations on
cached scalar data.

<P>The original purpose of this database was to allow the sscan record to
perform a preprogrammed dichroism measurement, in which a measurement is made
under two conditions (say, 'a' and 'b'), and the result (Ma-Mb)/(Ma+Mb) is
recorded.


<h3>IDctrl.db, xxIDCtrl.adl</h3>

<P>A front end for the APS insertion-device control system.  This database
allows an ID to be driven by a ca_put_callback() command.


<h3>Nano2k.db, Nano2k.adl</h3>

<P>Support for the Queensgate Nano2k piezo controller.

<h3>all_com_*.db</h3>

<P>Deprecated collection of databases for fanning out a "stop" command to all
motor records in an ioc, and for rolling up all motor-moving states into a
single PV.  The motor module has a better way of doing this (motorUtil.db, and
the motorUtilInit() command invoked from the ioc startup file).

<h3>pid_control.db, pid_*.adl</h3>

<P>Implements a PID (proportional/integral/differential) feedback loop, reading
values from a readback PV, comparing with a desired value, and writing
corrections to a control PV.  This record-based feedback loop is for low-speed 
applications, and is very general because it can use any EPICS PVs for readback
and control.

</P>

<h3>async_pid_control.db, async_pid_control.adl</h3>

<P>A version of pid_control with two improvements:

<ol>
<li>The readback PV can be an asynchronous record.  The std module implements
the "Async Soft Channel" device type for the epid record, which executes the
record's readback-trigger link, and waits for completion before reading the
result.
<li>The database provides a transform record to process the output value before
using it to drive the target PV.
</ol>

The original purpose of async_pid_control was to support feedback control with a
noisy readback device, by using the calc module's userAve10.db database to
average over a number of measurements.

<h3>fast_pid_control.db</h3>

<P>Implements a PID (proportional/integral/differential) feedback loop, reading
values from a readback PV, comparing with a desired value, and writing
corrections to a control PV.  This inerrupt-service-routine based loop can run
very fast (up to around 10 kHz) but is restricted in readback and control PVs.
The readback must be an appropriately supported analog input device, such as the
IP330 ADC, and the control must be an appropriately supported analog output
device, such as the DAV128V.

<h3>femto*.db, femto*.adl</h3>

<P>Support for Femto (brand name) low-noise current amplifier.

<h3>genTweak.db</h3>

<P>Adds tweak functionality to any floating point PV 

<h3>ramp_tweak.db, ramp_tweak*.adl</h3>

<P>Adds ramp and tweak functionality to any numeric PV.  To use, type the name
of the PV into the "targetPV:" text-entry field (or use Drag-And-Drop), and set
the step period and size.  If you don't want ramping, set the step size to zero.

<P>This database supports ca_put_callback.  When the desired-value or tweak
fields are written to by a ca_put_callback, the callback will not be sent until
the target has reached the new desired value.  The database also supports
autosave, and will correctly initialize itself after a reboot.

</P>

<h3>genericState.db, genericState.adl
genericStateAux.db
genericStrState.db</h3>

<P>I don't know what this is.

<h3>misc.db</h3>

<P>Miscellaneous PVs: burtResult, ISO8601 time-stamp string


<h3>pvHistory.db, pvHistory*.adl</h3>

<P>Collects values of up to three PVs in arrays for plotting as functions of
time.


<h3>autoShutter.vdb</h3>

<P>See <a href="README_autoShutter">README_autoShutter</a>

<h3>remoteShutter.db</h3>

<P>See <a href="README_remoteShutter">README_remoteShutter</a>

<h3>sampleWheel.db, sampleWheel*.adl</h3>
<P>Support for one particular sample holder.

<h3>scaler*.db, scaler*.adl</h3>

<P>Support for the scaler record.

<h3>softMotor.db, softMotor*.adl</h3>

<P>Support for a soft motor record that can be attached at run time to a real
motor or other motorlike collection of PVs.

<h3>timeString.db</h3>

<P>A stringin record with "Soft Timestamp" device support

<h3>alarmClock.vdb, alarmClock*.adl</h3>

<P>Cause a specified action to occur at a specified date and time.

<h3>countDownTimer.vdb, countDownTimer*.adl</h3>

<P>Cause a specified action to occur after a specified time interval.

<h3>timer.db, timer*.adl</h3>

<P>Cause a specified action to occur after a specified time interval

<h3>trend.db</h3>
<P>I don't know what this is.

<h3>userMbbos10.db, userMbbo*.adl</h3>
<P>Ten MBBO records.

<h3>zero.db, zero2.db</h3>

<P>A string-sequence record configured to zero a motor by putting it into "Set"
mode, writing zero to its VAL field, and putting it into "Use" mode.  zero2 does
the same thing for two motors.

<h3>selector.db</h3>

<P>A general purpose selector, which allows the deployer to attach a menu to a
list of actions.  For example, to implement control of a motor for which
discrete positions have special significance (mirror stripe, sample-wheel
angle), one edits selector.substitutions (see iocBoot/iocStdTest) with the names
and motor positions, and the target PV (or PVs) to which those positions should be
written.  The menu selection can be made by a client using ca_put_callback().

<P>It's possible to configure the target PV at run time.  If this is done, it's
important to note that the links shown below in selector_more.adl must have the
attribute "CA", because the record is configured to wait for completion, which
can't be done with a PP link.

<h2>Other code<hr></h2>
<h3>doAfterIocInit(char *cmd)</h3>

<P>Stores the string <tt>cmd</tt> and executes it with <tt>iocshCmd()</tt> after
iocInit.  This is useful to simplify maintenance of command files that specify
databases which must be paired with code (such as State Notation Language
programs) that must be invoked after iocInit. It's tedious and error prone to
have the commands separated.  doAfterIocInit() allows this:

<blockquote><pre>
# editSseq - edit any sseq or seq record
dbLoadRecords("$(CALC)/calcApp/Db/editSseq.db", "P=xxxL:,Q=ES:")
# Don't forget to run the sequence program, editSseq, below

...
unrelated commands
...

iocInit

...
more unrelated commands
...

seq &editSseq, 'P=xxxL:,Q=ES:'
</pre></blockquote>

to be replaced by this:

<blockquote><pre>
# editSseq - edit any sseq or seq record
dbLoadRecords("$(CALC)/calcApp/Db/editSseq.db", "P=xxxL:,Q=ES:")
doAfterIocInit("seq &editSseq, 'P=xxxL:,Q=ES:'")
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>vxCall(char *funcName [, char *arg1, char *arg2, ...])</h3>

<P>Searches the vxWorks symbol table for a function that matches the string
<tt>funcName</tt>, then executes the function with the given arguments.
<tt>vxCall</tt> will parse each argument to determine if it represents a 
number or a string and pass the correct values to the vxWorks function.
