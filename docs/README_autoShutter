RELEASE NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Initial release installed in synApps v5.2
1.2 Release Changes installed in synApps v5.2.1
     *  Redefined autoShutter.vdb 'BL' macro argument to include 
	the 'ID' or 'BM' identifier. 'BL' is now defined as a four character 
        beamline ID...
		<Sector #><ID/BM> (example: 08ID)
	See comments in xxx/iocBoot/iocvxWorks/autoShutter.substitutions. 

     *  Removed Shtr:Trigger OUT link to the remoteShutter Open PV. 
	The OUT link should be programmed at 'RUN' time to allow for
	more flexibility in how the shutter is opened. The OUT field
	is now in the backup/restore request file. 

	The OUT link is calculated by shtr:CalcTrigOutput to assure that
	the PP attribute is on the PV Link to the shutter Open record. . 

	The Trigger OUT link is checked by Shtr:TrigOutOK for a valid
	PV. The Shtr:Arm calc now includes the TrigOutOK check. 


      * Renamed old 'Shtr:Open' PV to 'Shtr:Active' and changed the
	ZNAM and ONAM to 'NO' and 'YES'. 

      * Changed autoShutter.vdb 'ALM' macro argument to 'A' to be consistant 
        with MEDM argument list. 

      * MEDM 'autoShutter.adl' 
		Shutter Control 'Edit' and status fields are added to reflect
		the changes to 'Shtr:Trigger.OUT' and 'Shtr:Arm'. 

      		Changed 'Last Open Timer' lable to 'Open Notify Timer'


		Added 'Shutter Control' section to allow programming 
		of 'Remote Shutter Control' PV. Red/Green status indicates
		if PV has been programmed or not.
